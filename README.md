# py-scrape
My web scraping project repository.

This project is stmilar to my Python web scraping project at work.  This is based on the libraries Requests and BeautifulSoup4, but is easily extensible to use other libraes.  The project's framework (in the subfolder "framework") was inspired by Kapow (https://www.kofax.com/Products/rpa/overview), software that my company has been using for a decade.
